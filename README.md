My solutions to [Advent of Code 2017][advent].

Uses [`stack`][stack] for management. Once it's installed, you can

run the tests with `stack test`, and install binaries with `stack install.`

Example input files are given as `input.txt` in every day directory. You can
get all outputs with `./all-answers.sh`
